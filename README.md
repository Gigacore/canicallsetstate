# ðŸ¤” Can I Call ```setState()``` ?
Handy little site to find if you can call setState() in any of React.js' lifecycle hooks.

### Running it on local

- ```git clone```
- ```npm i```
- ```npm run dev```

### Tech Stack

- React.js with Next.js
- styled-components

### TODOs

- Optimize for performance - Load Time, First Paint (FMP, FMC)
- Fix styled-components' SSR issue
- Fix UI issues, especially on mobile
- Provide more detailed information to better explain the limitations.
